# VotR

Welcome to **VotR**, an interactive voting platform designed for conference sessions. VotR allows speakers to create engaging presentations by pre-defining sessions with multiple-choice questions and answer options. Attendees can vote live during the session, making talks more interactive and memorable.

This repository is part of the conference session **"50 Years of Development Experience: What Could Possibly Go Wrong"** by **Sander Molenkamp** and **Eduard Keilholz**.

## üéØ Features

- **Session Management**: Speakers can pre-define sessions, questions, and multiple-choice answer options.
- **Live Voting**: Attendees can cast votes in real-time.
- **Results Display**: Real-time results visualization during the session.
- **Scalable Design**: Built to handle hundreds of votes simultaneously.
